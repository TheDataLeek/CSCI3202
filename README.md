# CSCI 3202 - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

I'm taking this class in fall of 2016, and here I'll put all my related
classwork and assignments.

# Installation

I use python 3.5 for these, including the syntax hinting and sometimes type
enforcement.

Make sure you install the dependencies with

```bash
┬─[william@fillory:~/Dropbox/classwork/2016b/csci3202]
╰─>$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
